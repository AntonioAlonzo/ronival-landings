        What is Co-Ownership?
      </div>
      <div class="acordeon-contenido">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Co-ownership involves sharing home ownership with other individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike timeshares, co-ownership is a deeded real estate interest,
            meaning you own an undivided share of the proper ty (e.g., one-
            eighth or one-sixth).
          </li>
          <li>
            People have been co-ownershipizing homes for decades, a concept
            reminiscent of friends sharing a ski bungalow.
          </li>
          <li>
            It has become quite popular, especially within the shared economy,
            as an alternative to outright real estate purchases.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="acordeon-contenido">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Co-Ownership:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Is deeded real estate with an undivided interest (e.g., 1/8,
                1/6).
              </li>
              <li>
                Follows the traditional appreciation of a whole ownership
                vacation resort property.
              </li>
              <li>Is a true investment.</li>

            Timeshare:
            <ul>
              <li>Traditionally a right-to-use or points-based program.</li>
              <li>
                Typically diminishes in value to almost nothing by the end of
                the ownership period.
              </li>
            </ul>

        Usage Flexibility in the Residence Club

        <ul>
          <li>Owners have equal access to the club.</li>
          <li>
            Not every owner will use it equally; some will use it less, meaning
            others can use it more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each member gets to pick three weeks at the beginning of the year.
          </li>
          <li>
            After everyone has picked their initial weeks, all owners have
            unlimited flexible usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            The caveat is they can only have one reser vation on the books at a

      <div class="acordeon-contenido">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Usage: Most people only use a vacation home 30 to 35 days a year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Costs: With whole ownership, all expenses must be paid regardless of
            usage, which can be hard to justify.
          </li>
          <li>
            Concerns: Being an absentee owner, especially in a foreign country,
            can be daunting due to management complexities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flexibility: Whole ownership can make owners feel "anchored" to a
            single location, limiting vacation options.

        The Elite Alliance "Residence Club" Model
      </div>
      <div class="acordeon-contenido">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Elite Alliance creates "enclaves of homes" that function much like a
            member equity golf club.
          </li>
          <li>
            Owners are deeded into a specific unit, but can stay in any of the
            units within their bedroom category within the club's net work.
          </li>
          <li>
            This allows multiple owners deeded to the same unit to satisfy their
            vacation needs simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members pay a fixed annual amount in dues, similar to country club
            dues, which covers all operational and maintenance expenses
            regardless of occupancy.

        <ul>

            Allows co-ownership owners to exchange time at their home property
            for stays at over 120 destinations worldwide.
          </li>
          <li>
            Owners reserve time at their home property, then deposit it into the
            exchange program to receive travel currency valid for two years.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system is a curated situation; owners don't meet each other or
            correspond directly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Destinations include Canada, US, Mexico, Argentina, Costa Rica,
            Europe, Caribbean, and Bermuda, covering ski resorts, beach
            locations, and metropolitan settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exchange costs range from $400 to $900 per vacation, plus the
            prevailing housekeeping rate at the destination property.
          </li>

            Instead of traditional rental ROI, Elite Alliance promotes a "return
            on your lifestyle".
          </li>
          <li>
            This is calculated as the annual savings compared to the cost of
            renting luxury proper ties.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, if renting costs $35,000 annually (35 nights at
            $1,000/night) and the annual assessment is $10,000, the savings are
            $25,000.
          </li>
          <li>
            This saving, divided by the purchase price, can yield a "double-
            digit return on your lifestyle investment".
          </li>
